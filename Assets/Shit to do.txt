5/27/22 - 9:28pm
- scroll in and out of map [Done]
- move left right up and down [Undone]
- We should have a fully functional map that has all the base interactions we would need  [Undone]

6/10/22
- implement terrain sprites  [Done]

6/10/22
- implement highlight,  [Done]
- fix previous tile name and type types  [Done]

6/11/22
- fix scale so camera can center and scroll properly  [Done]

6/13/22
- fix zoom, make sure you can scroll into particular hex  [Done]
-begin mapping our proper map generation  [UnDone]
	- so, proper ocean, forest, jungles etc
	- make sure you get the proper tiles and everything for it

6/14/22 - 4:59pm
- get distrubution curve of perlin map  [Done]
6/15/22 - 9:59pm
- find a means to refresh map  [Done]
- map generation is also kinda slow, when you change scale value  [Done]
6/16/22
- better procedural generation
	- current map isnt random enough
	- current perlin map is ass
6/18/22
- camera not centering,  [Done]
	- figure out why, perhaps it has to do while tile anchors/size [Done]
	- perhaps it has something to do with change sprite PPU [Done]
6/19/22
- adjust zoom for verticals[Done]
	- so when you are zoom up, the max is not adjust[Done]
	- when zoom down the minimim is adjusted for hexDistanceY/2 [Done]
6/21/22
- implement side scrolling [Done]
- implement for natural looking ecosystem
- looking into uniform distrubution of noice
6/22/22
- perhaps we could try sorting array
- get percentage value inbetween a set range and use it to map
7/1/22
- make map lets curvy 
	- using fractal noise 
		11:45pm
			- make fractal noise and other rng variables scale with map size
- make map use proper climate
	- use equator, to make heat, cold at poles
		- proper climate zones
- make map wraparound, left the right
	- maybe up to down
- Consider using a struct for the planet, that way we can easily pass/store around data about the planet

7/3/22
- consider making map generation faster

7/6/22
- make values for polar automatic based on planet size and initial temperature
	- i recommend setting equator temp to 1.5x the value of initial temp
	- same for polarfractal
- make bigger maps more watery,
	- you can do this by scaling the elevator ranges based on how big the map is, just as you did with fractal maps

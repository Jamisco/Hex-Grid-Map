In the Base Grid -- Sprite Manager component
	- The sprites are not properly accurate, I didnt have time to fix it. So you are going to have to manually adjust the sprites to their proper temperature
	
In the BaseGrid/CoastTile map - The Coast grid manager componenet, is not properly filled
	- click on that component, then click on Coast Sprites Rules Object,
		- Modify the coast sprite rules scriptable objects which can be found in LandScapes/Tiles/Coasts -- Attach the proper sprites to the proper tiling RUles...
			- I do believe the rules match the order of the sprites, but it is up to you to verify
			
Thesame must be done for Rivers...check Landscapes/Rivers 
	- Make sure the river mouths and rules all have their sprites


ALL SPRITES CAN BE FOUND IN THE SPRITES FOLDER

Last Update: v1.1.0 in August 2021

Description:
Hand-painted terrain hex tiles of tropical jungle, sandy palm forests, swamps, wetlands, and bogs! Use these to enliven your RPG overworld, strategy games, boardgame visuals, or whatever you can imagine.

- 9 biome types x 4 variations = 36 tiles
- includes 5 themed location types (temples, villages, etc)
- includes decor sprites (palms, trees, stumps, huts)
- painted at 256x384 pixels so that trees can overlap the tiles behind

Terrain types included:
- bog
- sand
- sand with palm forest
- grassy sand
- grassy sand with palm forest
- tropical plains
- tropical jungle (tropical plains with trees)
- wetlands
- swamp (wetlands with trees)

Usage:
These terrain hex tiles are intended to be drawn so that tiles in rows lower on the screen are drawn overtop of tiles in rows higher on the screen. This will ensure that trees, shrubs, etc. will appear to stand out and over the tiles 'behind' them.

These tiles are distributed at the size I painted them. If you want larger tiles, I suggest investigating an image upscaling algorithm that's tuned to painted images - upscaled results are remarkably good.

Future:
I gradually add more content to these sets based on interest levels, so feel free to email me with additional ideas to expand this asset set.

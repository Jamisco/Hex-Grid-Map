Last Update: v1.1 in September 2020

Description:
This is a set of lovingly hand-painted 2D terrain hexes of deserts suitable for an overworld, a strategy game, or boardgame-like visuals. 
- 15 tile types x 4 variations each + 20 additional location tiles (including many variants on a type) = 80 tiles total 
- painted at 256x384 pixels so that cacti, hills, and mesas can overlap the tiles behind 
- 67 decor sprites (rocks, trees, grass, etc) with transparent backgrounds

Terrain types included: 
- rocky yellow desert x4 (+salt flats and crater)
- saguaro yellow desert forest x4
- sandy yellow desert x4
- yellow desert base x4
- yellow desert hills x4 (+4 w/ oases)
- yellow desert mesas x4 (+4 w/ caves)
- yellow desert large mesa x2 (+2x cave and oasis variants)
- rocky red desert x4
- grassy red desert x4 (x2 w/ oases)
- grassy red desert savannah/forest x4 (x2 with oases)
- grassy red desert hills x4 (x2 w/ oases)
- grass red desert mountains x4 (x4 with caves)
- red desert base x4
- grassy red desert with dunes x4
- red desert large mesa (+1 with cave)

Usage:
These terrain hexes are intended to be drawn to screen so that hexes in rows lower on the screen are drawn overtop those in rows higher on the screen. This will ensure that trees, hills, and mountains will appear to stand out overtop of hexes "behind" them.

Future:
I keep a list of new content suggestions to add to my various content packs (tiles, icons, whatever) and will try to update them from time to time as I fix errors and add new art. Please feel free to send me an email to let me know your thoughts, show off your work, or let me know if anything needs to be fixed!

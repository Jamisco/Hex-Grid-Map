# Hex Grid Map

Guys please dont use those tiles for other projects,
I cannot confirm whether or not that is legal, although they were originally purchased by me
I am not sure if the terms of service allows for them to be used by others on their own projects

This project is here for educational purposes, just as I have learned alot from others to make this project
I made this project so you can learn alot. And hopefully, when you all make your projects you too can help others learn
That way, we all suffer less

Here is a video of the project running

----------- UPDATE, please be aware that the serialzed fields have been lost entirely in this git. Thus when you download the program, you will have to manually fill in the sprites and hexes.
Additionally, you should download the 2D Tilemap extra from the package manager.

# Hex Grid Map

Guys please dont use those tiles for other projects,
I cannot confirm whether or not that is legal, although they were originally purchased by me
I am not sure if the terms of service allows for them to be used by others on their own projects

This project is here for educational purposes, just as I have learned alot from others to make this project
I made this project so you can learn alot. And hopefully, when you all make your projects you too can help others learn
That way, we all suffer less

Here is a video of the project running

----------- UPDATE, please be aware that the serialzed fields have been lost entirely in this git. Thus when you download the program, you will have to manually fill in the sprites and hexes.
Additionally, you should download the 2D Tilemap extra from the package manager.

---- UPDATE 2/19/26 -----
All .meta files have been restored so no more script missing errors from gameobjects.
That said, you are going to have to manually fill in the sprites in Sample scene, BaseGrid gameobject, SpriteManager component/script. This is no easy feat and will probably require at most 1 hour of your time.

Aside from that, all errors with the code have been fixed and everything should work. If there are any errors, please do contact me.

I also recommend you look at using my Updated Gridmap and Gridmap Maker

This project is decapretated. I am working on a new and better one which will allow for faster generation and rendering speed while also allowing for more versitality.
